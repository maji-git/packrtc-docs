# About PackCloud

PackCloud is the default signaling server for PackRTC. Located at [packcloud.himaji.xyz](https://packcloud.himaji.xyz/). At through it's okay to use it in development/small games. We don't recommend using it in production, as the server's not reliable enough to handle large traffic.
